# Classes-iOS

## The Goal

The goal of this code is to learn more about Classes in Swift as well as their similarities and differences from structs. Iâ€™ll compare objects created from classes with instances of Structs that I learnt about earlier. 

## What will be created

By the end of the module, I would have made a simple game with different characters and show how each inherit and interact with the other. 

## What I will learn

* Classes.
* OOP.
* Overriding methods. 
* Pass by value vs. pass by reference. 
* Formatting Strings.
